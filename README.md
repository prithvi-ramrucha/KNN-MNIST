# KNN-MNIST
This repository contains a from-scratch implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) algorithm, applied to the MNIST handwritten digit dataset, using SlowLearn (a custom, work-in-progress machine learning library built for learning and experimentation). No high-level ML frameworks (e.g. scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow) are used for the model itself. The focus is on understanding the full end-to-end ML pipeline and algorithmic behaviour rather than performance optimisation.
